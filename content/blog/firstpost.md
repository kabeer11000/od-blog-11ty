Accessibility isn't just a checkbox to tick before launchâ€”it's a fundamental aspect of creating meaningful digital experiences. When we design and build with accessibility in mind from the start, we create better products for everyone.

At The Other Dev, we've seen too many projects where accessibility becomes an afterthought, leading to rushed implementations and subpar user experiences. Here's how we approach building accessible web experiences from day one.

## Start with Semantic HTML

The foundation of accessible web development is semantic HTML. When you use the right elements for the right purpose, you get accessibility features for free:

```html
<!-- Instead of this -->
<div class="button" onclick="handleClick()">Submit</div>

<!-- Use this -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

Semantic elements provide context to screen readers and other assistive technologies, making your content navigable and understandable.

```diff-js
 // this is a command
 function myCommand() {
+  let counter = 0;
-  let counter = 1;
   counter++;
 }

 // Test with a line break above this line.
 console.log('Test');
```
