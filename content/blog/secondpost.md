In today's digital landscape, performance isn't just nice to haveâ€”it's essential. Users expect websites to load instantly, and search engines reward fast sites with better rankings. But how do you build performant websites without compromising on design or functionality?

At The Other Dev, we've developed a performance-first approach that ensures every project is optimized from the ground up.

## Measure Before You Optimize

The first rule of performance optimization: measure everything. You can't improve what you don't measure.

We use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Core Web Vitals to establish baselines and track improvements:

```js
// Example: Measuring performance with the Performance API
const navigationStart = performance.timing.navigationStart;
const loadComplete = performance.timing.loadEventEnd;
const loadTime = loadComplete - navigationStart;

console.log(`Page load time: ${loadTime}ms`);
```

## Critical Resource Prioritization

Not all resources are created equal. Critical resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript needed for above-the-fold content) should be prioritized over non-critical assets.

Performance optimization is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. By building performance awareness into your development workflow, you create faster, more engaging experiences for your users.
