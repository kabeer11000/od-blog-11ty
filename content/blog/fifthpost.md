The web development landscape is evolving at breakneck speed. As we look toward the future, several key trends are emerging that will fundamentally change how we build digital experiences.

At The Other Dev, we're constantly evaluating new technologies to understand their potential impact on our projects and our clients' success. Here are the trends we're watching most closely.

## AI-Powered Development Tools

Artificial intelligence is transforming how we write code, from GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT-assisted debugging. But the real game-changer will be AI that understands entire codebases and can suggest architectural improvements.

## Edge Computing and Performance

Moving computation closer to users through edge computing is enabling new possibilities for real-time applications and reducing latency for global audiences.

*This post is currently in draft as we continue researching these emerging trends.*
