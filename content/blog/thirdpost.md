CSS has evolved dramatically in recent years, giving us powerful new tools for building sophisticated user interfaces. As frontend developers, staying current with modern CSS techniques can significantly improve both developer experience and user outcomes.

Let's explore some game-changing CSS features that are reshaping how we approach UI development.

## Container Queries: True Component-Based Responsive Design

Container queries allow components to respond to their container's size rather than the viewport, enabling truly modular responsive design:

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
}
```

This approach lets components adapt based on available space, making them truly reusable across different contexts.

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```

### Heading with a [link](#code)

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
